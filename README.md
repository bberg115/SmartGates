Smart gates for Tiny Whooping

Work in progress..

Ideas:</br>
  Phase 1:</br>
    Tracking a single channel at >1 different gates to:</br>
        1. Track overall time</br>
        2. Track lap time</br>
        3. Track best lap time for configuration</br>
        4. # of laps (total or of configuration)</br>
        5. Light up the next set of gates</br>
          a. Change colors of next gates to easily identify</br>
          b. Change course based on event (lap time, # of laps, etc).</br>
          </br>
  Phase 2:</br>
    Scanning channels? Determine the # of channels that can be scanned (time between scan?)</br>
