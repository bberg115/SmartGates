Smart gates for Tiny Whooping

Work in progress..

Ideas:
  Phase 1:
    Tracking a single channel at >1 different gates to:
        1. Track overall time
        2. Track lap time
        3. Track best lap time for configuration
        4. # of laps (total or of configuration)
        5. Light up the next set of gates
          a. Change colors of next gates to easily identify
          b. Change course based on event (lap time, # of laps, etc).
  Phase 2:
    Scanning channels? Determine the # of channels that can be scanned (time between scan?)
