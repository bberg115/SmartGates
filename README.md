Smart gates for FPV Stuffs

Work in progress..

# Ideas:</br>
##  Phase 1:</br>
    1. Tracking a single channel at >1 different gates to:</br>
       1. Track overall time</br>
       2. Track lap time</br>
       3. Track best lap time for configuration</br>
       4. # of laps (total or of configuration)</br>
       5. Light up the next set of gates</br>
          a. Change colors of next gates to easily identify</br>
          b. Change course based on event (lap time, # of laps, etc).</br>
          </br>
##  Phase 2:</br>
    1. Scanning channels? Determine the # of channels that can be scanned (time between scan?)</br>
