Smart gates for FPV Stuffs indoors
Plan on using Delta5 timer with remote ESP01s to trigger field gates.

Work in progress..

# Ideas:
##  Phase 1: Delta 5
    1. Track up to 4 channels:
       1. Track overall time
       2. Track lap time
       3. Track best lap time for configuration
       4. # of laps (total or of configuration)
##  Phase 2: ESP's + LEDs
       1. Each channel is assigned a color and changes start finish gate based on trigger.
            a. First place color
            b. Last to pass gate color
       2. Last lap gate color change
       3. Talk to remote (ESP-01) to trigger field gates
       4. Changing course:
            a. Odd vs Even lap changes
